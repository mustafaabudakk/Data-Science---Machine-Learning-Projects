# Visualization Notes
1- The Bitcoin project was created through Datacamp.

2- with COVID19 notebook, the visualization of COVID19 by date and country was made. The current date is 08.05.2020. You can look below for more detailed information.

Due to Github's Plotly restriction, showing images is problematic. As a solution, you can easily view the Jupyter laptop viewer with a core connection attached. The link is below.
