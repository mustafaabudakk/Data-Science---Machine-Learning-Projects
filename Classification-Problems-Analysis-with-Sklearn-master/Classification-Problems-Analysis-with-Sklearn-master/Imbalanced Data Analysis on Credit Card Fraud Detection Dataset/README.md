# Imbalance-Data-Analysis-with-Python
This Dataset was downloaded via <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>.

You are working on your dataset.
You create a classification model and immediately get 90% accuracy. Isn't this result really great? We go a little further and discover that almost all of the data belongs to a class. How can we say this? Imbalanced data can hurt our heads in this case.
I can predict the facial expression that occurs when you discover the imbalance.
This dataset is an example of the situation of an imbalanced dataset and the annoying results it can cause.
In this notebook, we will explore techniques that we can use to achieve excellent but truly excellent results in our dataset containing imbalanced data. In particular we will consider:Â¶

- What does imbalanced data mean?
- What is the paradox of truth?
- What are the various approaches to the processing of imbalanced data?
